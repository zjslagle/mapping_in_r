# mapping_in_r
Learn to load, manipulate, and display spatial data in R.  

I owe most/all of my knowledge to the publicly available, open source book *Geocomputation with R* by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow. [This resource is freely available here.](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)  

Other debts are owed to the [developers of the sf (simple features) package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/authors.html) and the [developers of the tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/citation.html).
